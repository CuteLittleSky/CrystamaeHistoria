水晶编年史是一个 Slimefun4 附属插件 (目前仍在制作中,有许多内容需要添加) 。该附属插件添加了一系列的咒语，以及用于创建与解锁新咒语的进度系统。

Any major event or experience leaves its mark on the surrounding area. Historia allows you to harness this by drawing
out the raw essence of these experiences from blocks.

## 记录者

记录者是一个魔法装置，你可以从方块中获取它们经历过的故事。当这些故事被发掘出来后，可以直接在方块上阅读。这些故事有不同的等级，以方块的类型来确定。

## The Realisation Altar

The Realisation Altar will take the stories that have been discovered on blocks and slowly draw out the magical energy
from them. This energy slowly begins to crystalize around the altar and, when fully matured, can be broken giving you
magic in its physical form. The type of crystal you get is dependent on the type of story that was used to form it.

## The Liquefaction Basin

One of the primary uses for magical crystals is the Liquefaction Basin. The Basin will take any crystals thrown into it
and convert them into a liquid state (Crystamae). When a valid catalyst is thrown in, the contents of the basin are
absorbed to create a magical artefact, the result being based on the types of Crystamae in the basin.

Be careful when using the basin though, a wrong recipe will ruin all your materials and, sometimes, have devastating
effects.

## Magical Plates

Using a steel plate as a catalyst, you can create a magical imbued plate. The plate will absorb the magic given to it
and, based on the top 3 magical values, will produce a plate that is able to channel a magical spell. 80 possible plate
combinations are available meaning 80 possible magical spells. Plates are attached to Staves using the Stave
Configurator.

Plates hold the potential for a magical spell but will need refilling with Crystamae as charges are used up. There is no
limit to the stored charges. charges are restored by dropping a pre-made plate into a basin with the same contents as
when it was first made.

## Stave Configurator

A Stave is, surprisingly, very easy to craft and source. The downside being is that the Stave does nothing by itself.
Just like some sorcerers use runes to imbue a staff with magic, the Stave requires a filled Magical Plate to channel
magic. The configurator allows you to add/remove 4 plates to the Stave at any given time. Each plate binds it's spell to
a specific player action (Left, Right, Shift-Left and Shift-Right click). Plates can be added and removed freely to
customise your load-out whenever.
